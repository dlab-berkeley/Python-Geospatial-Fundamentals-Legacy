# Common questions and answers

This document lists comment questions and their respective answers pointing to specific parts of the workshop files. 

I’m having trouble installing `GeoPandas` on a Windows computer.
- I’m having trouble installing `GeoPandas` on a Mac and I usually use pip install.
- When using pip to install GeoPandas, you need to make sure that all dependencies are installed correctly. Fiona provides binary wheels with the dependencies included for Mac and Linux. The easiest way to attempt to fix this, first order, is to uninstall geopandas and it’s dependencies and reinstall. 

I’m having trouble with packages versions not working with each other.
- You can try creating a virtual environment, see the bottom of the [README](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Geospatial-Fundamentals-in-Python/blob/master/README.md)
