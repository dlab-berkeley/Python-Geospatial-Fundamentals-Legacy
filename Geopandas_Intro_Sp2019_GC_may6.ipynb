Most of the sample data and use cases are related to a UC Berkeley research a project that I have been working on called [The Louisiana Slave Conspiracies](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/landing-page/louisiana-slave-conspiracies). This project explores several slave conspiracies that occured in colonial Louisiana during the late 1700s and early 1800s. Since very little data exist for this time period, we begin with an exploration of US Census data from the early 1800s, shortly after the Louisiana Purchase made the Louisiana and Orleans Territories part of the United States.\n",
