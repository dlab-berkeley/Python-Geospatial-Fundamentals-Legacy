    "[GeoPandas](http://geopandas.org/) is a relatively new package that makes it easier to work with geospatial data in Python. In the last few years it has grown more powerful and stable. This is really great because previously it was quite complex to work with geospatial data in Python. GeoPandas is now the go-to package for working with `vector` geospatial data in Python. \n",
